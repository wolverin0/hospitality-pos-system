The witness, refinery, and polecat lifecycle components didn't coordinate automatically.\n\n## What Should Have Happened\n\n```\nMayor slings 6 beads to rig\n    ↓\nPolecats auto-spawn with synced beads, work pinned\n    ↓\nPolecats work autonomously\n    ↓\nWitness monitors progress, nudges stuck polecats\n    ↓\nPolecat completes → pushes branch → signals completion\n    ↓\nRefinery detects ready branch → rebases → merges → deletes branch\n    ↓\nWitness detects merge → nukes polecat worktree\n    ↓\nWhen all done → Witness notifies Mayor\n```\n\n## What Actually Happened\n\n1. **gt sling failed to pin beads** - polecat worktrees had stale JSONL\n2. **Manual intervention** - had to checkout latest JSONL, pin, nudge each polecat\n3. **Witness was passive** - never nudged or checked on polecats\n4. **Refinery waited for requests** - didn't detect completed branches\n5. **Manual lifecycle** - Mayor had to close beads, nuke polecats\n6. **Manual merge coordination** - had to mail refinery with merge order\n\n## Root Cause: Branch Hysteresis\n\nPolecat branches persist across runs and drift from main/beads-sync:\n- `polecat/foo` created weeks ago from old main\n- New work slung to `polecat/foo` \n- JSONL in branch doesn't have new beads\n- Pin fails\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### Q1: Fresh branches per run?\nShould each polecat spawn create a NEW branch from latest main/beads-sync?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig\n  → creates polecat/foo-20251227-1630 from origin/main\n  → ensures JSONL is current\n  → after merge, branch deleted forever\n```\nPros: No drift, always current\nCons: Branch proliferation, naming complexity\n\n### Q2: Rebase existing branches?\nOr should we rebase persistent polecat branches before work?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig/foo\n  → git fetch origin\n  → git rebase origin/main\n  → now JSONL is current\n```\nPros: Keeps simple naming\nCons: Rebase can fail with conflicts\n\n### Q3: Just cherry-pick JSONL?\nMinimal fix - grab latest JSONL before pinning:\n```\ngit checkout origin/beads-sync -- .beads/issues.jsonl\nbd import  # refresh DB\nbd pin bd-xxx\n```\nPros: Simple, surgical\nCons: Doesn't fix code drift, just beads\n\n### Q4: Shared beads DB?\nCould polecats share a DB (via symlink or sqlite over network)?\nPros: Always consistent\nCons: Locking complexity, daemon conflicts\n\n### Q5: Who owns polecat lifecycle?\n- Witness? (current assumption)\n- Refinery? (after merge)\n- gt sling? (on spawn)\n- New \"foreman\" role?\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSee child issues for implementation details.

{"id":"gt-t6muy","title":"Design: Polecat lifecycle and patrol coordination","description":"## Context\n\nThis design captures thinking from a deep session about the Gas Town propulsion system - how Deacon, Witness, Refinery, and Polecats coordinate to move work smoothly through the system.\n\n## Core Insight: Session-Per-Step Model\n\nPolecats do NOT complete complex molecules end-to-end. Instead:\n- One polecat SESSION per molecule STEP\n- Same sandbox (branch/worktree) persists across sessions\n- Each step: spawn → work → close bead → recycle session\n- Final step: spawn → work → close bead → signal complete → merge → nuke sandbox\n\n## Two Cleanup Stages\n\n| Stage | Trigger | Kills | Survives |\n|-------|---------|-------|----------|\n| Step cleanup | Step bead closed | Session | Branch, worktree, molecule |\n| Molecule cleanup | Merged | Session, branch, worktree | Digest |\n\n## Per-Rig Polecat Channel\n\nNeed a mailing list/queue per rig for session-lifecycle requests:\n- \"Recycle me\" (from polecat)\n- \"Recycle worker X\" (from witness/mayor)\n- \"Spawn for step Y\" (from anyone)\n\nFirst-come-first-served by patrolling agents. Anyone on patrol (Witness, Refinery, Crew, Mayor) can service requests.\n\n## GUPP + Pinned Work = Completion\n\nAs long as:\n1. Work is pinned to polecat identity (e.g., gastown/furiosa)\n2. Sandbox persists (branch + worktree)\n3. Someone keeps spawning polecat when it dies\n\n→ The molecule WILL get finished. GUPP ensures wake-and-work.\n\n## Daemon → Deacon Heartbeat\n\nThe daemon pings the deacon, keeping the cycle alive. Deacon peeks into rig-wide channels during patrol and can service lifecycle requests.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n### Q1: Spoon-Feeding Bin-Packing\nTwo dimensions of granularity trade-offs:\n- How many logical steps per physical molecule step?\n- How many molecule steps per polecat session?\n\nToo few steps → context exhaustion, forgetting\nToo many steps → overhead, fragmentation\n\nNeeds: Analysis of optimal granularity based on step complexity.\n\n### Q2: Mechanical vs Agent-Driven Recycling\nCaution from deacon murder spree bug: mechanical detection of \"stuck\" workers is fragile.\n\nPrefer: Explicit \"recycle me\" requests serviced by patrol agents.\n\nQuestion: When is mechanical intervention appropriate?\n\n### Q3: Channel Implementation\nOptions:\n- Mail-based (gt mail to rig/polecats)\n- Beads-based (special issue type)\n- State file (rig/polecat-queue.json)\n\nMail seems most consistent with Gas Town patterns.\n\n### Q4: Who Spawns Next Step?\nCurrent: gt sling spawns fresh polecat\nNeeded: Mechanism for \"continue molecule on existing sandbox\"\n\nMaybe: gt sling --continue or witness detects pending step.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-dtw9u: Witness monitoring (enhance survey-workers)\n- gt-qpwv4: Completion detection (check ready branches)\n- gt-6qyt1: Refinery queue (process MERGE_READY)\n- gt-budeb: Auto-nuke (handle MERGED signal)\n- gt-5j3ia: Swarm aggregation (batch completion)\n- gt-1dbcp: Polecat auto-start (SessionStart hook issue)\n\n## Design Principles (from HOP/MEOW context)\n\n1. **Discovery over tracking** - observe reality each cycle\n2. **Mail as coordination primitive** - agents signal via mail\n3. **ZFC** - Claude makes judgment calls, no hardcoded thresholds\n4. **Redundant monitoring** - overlapping observation is resilience\n5. **Wisps are ephemeral** - patrol molecules flow like water\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

It is about waiting for signals with a timeout.**\n\nThis epic captures the shift from time-driven to event-driven patrol wake.\n\n## Key Insight (Recovered from 2025-12-29 session crash)\n\nThe Beads activity feed (bd activity --follow) is the universal data plane for\nwake signals. Every meaningful action creates a beads mutation; agents subscribe to\nthe feed and wake within ~500ms. The timeout is just a safety net.\n\n**OLD**: Time-driven. Wake because time passed. Poll less when idle.\n**NEW**: Event-driven. Wake because signal arrived. Timeout is safety net.\n\n## Architecture\n\nANY MUTATION:\n  bd create/update/close -\u003e issues.jsonl mutation\n                        -\u003e bd activity --follow sees it (~500ms)\n                        -\u003e All subscribed agents wake immediately\n\nPATROL AGENT:\n  Runs bd activity --follow as background source\n  Any output line = wake signal\n  Timeout expiry = safety net (not primary wake)\n\n## Wake Sources (Priority Order)\n\n| Source | Latency | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| Feed | ~500ms | Primary - any beads mutation |\n| Nudge | Instant | Explicit wake (startup hooks) |\n| Timeout | Backoff | Safety net for missed signals |\n| Daemon | 5-60min | GUPP backstop, session recovery |\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. No wake_on conditions - signals carry no semantic meaning. Just wake up.\n   Agent discovers reality by checking mail, beads, hook, git state.\n\n2. Read-only commands do not wake - gt status, bd show create no mutations.\n\n3. Daemon is recovery-focused - catches edge cases (GUPP violations, dead sessions).\n\n4.
